# GDSC UM Android Developement Challenge
Hi! I'm Choo Xiang Lun, a first-year computer science student from the University of Malaya. This is my submission for the Android Development Challenge organized by Google Developer Student Club from the University of Malaya. The task is to either create an diary application (called Idiary) from scratch, or to modify the Idiary application source code provided by the organizer. The participation method that I chose is to **create my own application from scratch**. Hope you'll like my version of the Idiary application!! :D

## My Idiary Logo

## Standouts:
UI :
- I design a brand new logo and new UX design
- animated transition between pages (sliding transition)

Extra features:
-  User can view, edit and delete diaries
-  Different hints to inspire user to start writing a diary
-  User can add multiple images instead of just one
-  Prevent user from accidentally quit editing diary, thus, losing their progress
-  User can enable lock screen feature to ensure that their diary is secure from their friends and whatnot.
-  User can unlock the lock screen by using fingerprint. This allows user to enter the application more quickly/
-  Profile page let users to set up their profile
-  User can upload image by capturing a new image using camera

Firebase connection:
- I came out with new database structure to store multiple images and user's profile info

## Summary
I don't have any android development knowledge before. But the insightful workshops and the mentorhip provided by the GDSC UM teams help me alot, and eventually, I was able to create my own app from scratch. Thank you for the effort! It has been a wonderful journey along the way (/≧▽≦)/
